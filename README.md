# Real-Time-Speaker-Identification-using-ECAPA-TDNN
This project implements a **real-time speaker identification system** using the **ECAPA-TDNN** model from [SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io/).   It enables users to speak into a microphone through a web interface, processes the audio in real time, and identifies the speaker based on pre-enrolled voice embeddings.
